For example, specific libraries may create outputs that are not accessible to screen readers, and default export options may create outputs that have issues related to contrast or keyboard navigation. Further, it is important to note that, currently, editing Jupyter Notebooks is largely not accessible for screen reader users.</p> <p>Despite these serious challenges, there are ways that notebook authors can create notebooks that are more accessible for users with disabilities. This document will give context on accessibility in Jupyter Notebooks and provide some tips and best practices for authoring and publishing accessible notebooks.</p>"},{"location":"exports/resources/event-hackathon/accessibility-tips-for-jupyter-notebooks/#notebook-formats","title":"Notebook Formats","text":"<p>Depending on the export method and content, notebooks can allow for different levels of accessibility for people using assistive technology. Users encounter notebooks in a variety of formats:</p> <ul> <li>The editable notebook format \u2014 This format is designed to be opened directly in the Jupyter environment for editing and take the form of <code>.ipynb</code> files. This format is currently inaccessible to screen reader users and has many obstacles to navigating the UI and editing cells</li> <li>Uneditable notebooks exported to HTML \u2014 These <code>.html</code> files created through the <code>nb-convert</code> exporter are designed to be opened in a browser and are often shared on the web. This format is somewhat accessible because HTML is built for web accessibility. While there are issues, people tend to succeed in accessing a majority of notebooks exported in this format.</li> </ul> <p>The interactive notebook format still does not play well with assistive technology, particularly in navigating the UI and editing cells. The exported \u201cread only\u201d notebooks can be read fairly well, but still have some issues. If you want your content to be 100% accessible, Jupyter notebooks are currently not the best way to publish your content (though they can be converted to HTML for a better read-only accessibility experience). Consider if there is an alternate format that could work just as well, or publish a \u201cread only\u201d export alongside the editable one so at least the content is readable by everyone. That said, things will not be truly accessible until we provide access to content creation, not just knowledge consumption.</p> <p>There is work to be done to improve the way Jupyter Notebooks are exported to HTML, and we are running tests with affected users to figure out what changes would best improve accessibility in this area. Eventually, we hope to push changes and improvements upstream. This is a slow process with not enough people working on it. We have several open issues and hopefully our team and others will make improvements in the next few years. But that does not solve the problem right now.</p> <p>Since editable notebooks published as <code>.ipynb</code> files currently have serious issues related to accessibility, there is little that notebook authors can do to help people with disabilities access this format.
